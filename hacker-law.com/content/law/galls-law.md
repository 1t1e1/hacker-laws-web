[Gall's Law on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall_(author)#Gall's_law)

> A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system.

Gall's Law implies that attempts to _design_ highly complex systems are likely to fail. Highly complex systems are rarely built in one go, but evolve instead from more simple systems.

The classic example is the world-wide-web. In it's current state, it is a highly complex system. However, it was defined initially as a simple way to share content between academic institutions. It was very successful in meeting these goals and evolved to become more complex over time.
