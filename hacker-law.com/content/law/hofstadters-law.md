You might hear this law referred to when looking at estimates for how long something will take. It seems a truism in software development that we tend to not be very good at accurately estimating how long something will take to deliver.

This is from the book '[Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid](#reading-list)'.
