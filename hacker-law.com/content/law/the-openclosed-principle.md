> Entities should be open for extension and closed for modification.

The second of the '[SOLID]({{< ref "solid.md" >}})' principles. This principle states that entities (which could be classes, modules, functions and so on) should be able to have their behaviour _extended_, but that their _existing_ behaviour should not be able to be modified.

As a hypothetical example, imagine a module which is able to turn a Markdown document into HTML. If the module could be extended to handle a newly proposed markdown feature, without modifying the module internals, then it would be open for extension. If the module could _not_ be modified by a consumer so that how existing Markdown features are handled, then it would be _closed_ for modification.

This principle has particular relevance for object-oriented programming, where we may design objects to be easily extended, but would avoid designing objects which can have their existing behaviour changed in unexpected ways.
