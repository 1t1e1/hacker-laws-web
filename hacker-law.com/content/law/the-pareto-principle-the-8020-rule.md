[The Pareto Principle on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle)

> Most things in life are not distributed evenly.

The Pareto Principle suggests that in some cases, the majority of results come from a minority of inputs:

- 80% of a certain piece of software can be written in 20% of the total allocated time (conversely, the hardest 20% of the code takes 80% of the time)
- 20% of the effort produces 80% of the result
- 20% of the work creates 80% of the revenue
- 20% of the bugs cause 80% of the crashes
- 20% of the features cause 80% of the usage

In the 1940s American-Romanian engineer Dr. Joseph Juran, who is widely credited with being the father of quality control, [began to apply the Pareto principle to quality issues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_M._Juran).

This principle is also known as: The 80/20 Rule, The Law of the Vital Few and The Principle of Factor Sparsity.

Real-world examples:

- In 2002 Microsoft reported that by fixing the top 20% of the most-reported bugs, 80% of the related errors and crashes in windows and office would become eliminated ([Reference](https://www.crn.com/news/security/18821726/microsofts-ceo-80-20-rule-applies-to-bugs-not-just-features.htm)).
