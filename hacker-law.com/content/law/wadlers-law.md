> In any language design, the total time spent discussing a feature in this list is proportional to two raised to the power of its position.
>
> 0. Semantics
> 1. Syntax

Similar to [The Law of Triviality]({{< ref "the-law-of-triviality.md" >}}), Wadler's Law states what when designing a language, the amount of time spent on language structures is disproportionately high in comparison to the importance of those features.
