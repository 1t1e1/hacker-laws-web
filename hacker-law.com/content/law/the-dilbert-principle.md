> Companies tend to systematically promote incompetent employees to management to get them out of the workflow.

> _Scott Adams_

A management concept developed by Scott Adams (creator of the Dilbert comic strip), the Dilbert Principle is inspired by [The Peter Principle]({{< ref "the-peter-principle.md" >}}). Under the Dilbert Principle, employees who were never competent are promoted to management in order to limit the damage they can do. Adams first explained the principle in a 1995 Wall Street Journal article, and expanded upon it in his 1996 business book, [The Dilbert Principle](#reading-list).
