> In network theory, the value of a system grows as approximately the square of the number of users of the system.

This law is based on the number of possible pairwise connections within a system and is closely related to [Reed's Law]({{< ref "reeds-law.md" >}}). Odlyzko and others have argued that both Reed's Law and Metcalfe's Law overstate the value of the system by not accounting for the limits of human cognition on network effects; see [Dunbar's Number]({{< ref "dunbars-number.md" >}}).
