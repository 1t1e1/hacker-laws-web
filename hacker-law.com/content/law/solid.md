This is an acronym, which refers to:

* S: [The Single Responsibility Principle]({{< ref "the-single-responsibility-principle.md" >}})
* O: [The Open/Closed Principle]({{< ref "the-openclosed-principle.md" >}})
* L: [The Liskov Substitution Principle]({{< ref "the-liskov-substitution-principle.md" >}})
* I: [The Interface Segregation Principle]({{< ref "the-interface-segregation-principle.md" >}})
* D: [The Dependency Inversion Principle]({{< ref "the-dependency-inversion-principle.md" >}})

These are key principles in [Object-Oriented Programming](#todo). Design principles such as these should be able to aid developers build more maintainable systems.
