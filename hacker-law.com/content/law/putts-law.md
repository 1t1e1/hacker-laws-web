[Putt's Law on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putt%27s_Law_and_the_Successful_Technocrat)

> Technology is dominated by two types of people, those who understand what they do not manage and those who manage what they do not understand.

Putt's Law is often followed by Putt's Corollary:

> Every technical hierarchy, in time, develops a competence inversion.

These statements suggest that due to various selection criteria and trends in how groups organise, there will be a number of skilled people at working levels of a technical organisations, and a number of people in managerial roles who are not aware of the complexities and challenges of the work they are managing. This can be due to phenomena such as [The Peter Principle]({{< ref "the-peter-principle.md" >}}) or [The Dilbert Principle]({{< ref "the-dilbert-principle.md" >}}).

However, it should be stressed that Laws such as this are vast generalisations and may apply to _some_ types of organisations, and not apply to others.
