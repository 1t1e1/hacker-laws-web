[The DRY Principle on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)

> Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.

DRY is an acronym for _Don't Repeat Yourself_. This principle aims to help developers reducing the repetition of code and keep the information in a single place and was cited in 1999 by Andrew Hunt and Dave Thomas in the book [The Pragmatic Developer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pragmatic_Programmer)

> The opposite of DRY would be _WET_ (Write Everything Twice or We Enjoy Typing).

In practice, if you have the same piece of information in two (or more) different places, you can use DRY to merge them into a single one and reuse it wherever you want/need.
