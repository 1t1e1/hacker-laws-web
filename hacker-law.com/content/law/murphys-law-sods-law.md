[Murphy's Law on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law)

> Anything that can go wrong will go wrong.

Related to [Edward A. Murphy, Jr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_A._Murphy_Jr.) _Murphy's Law_ states that if a thing can go wrong, it will go wrong.

This is a common adage among developers. Sometimes the unexpected happens when developing, testing or even in production. This can also be related to the (more common in British English) _Sod's Law_:

> If something can go wrong, it will, at the worst possible time.

These 'laws' are generally used in a comic sense. However, phenomena such as [_Confirmation Bias_](#TODO) and [_Selection Bias_](#TODO) can lead people to perhaps over-emphasise these laws (the majority of times when things work, they go unnoticed, failures however are more noticeable and draw more discussion).
