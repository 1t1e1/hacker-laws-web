A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system.</p><p>(<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall_(author)>John Gall</a>)</p></blockquote><p>Gall&rsquo;s Law implies that attempts to <em>design</em> highly complex systems are likely to fail. Highly complex systems are rarely built in one go, but evolve instead from more simple systems.</p><p>The classic example is the world-wide-web. In it&rsquo;s current state, it is a highly complex system. However, it was defined initially as a simple way to share content between academic institutions. It was very successful in meeting these goals and evolved to become more complex over time.</p><p>See also:</p><ul><li><a href=https://1t1e1.github.io/hacker-laws-web/law/the-kiss-principle/>KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)</a></li></ul></div></article></div></main></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__copyright>Â© 2020 My Hugo Site. <span class=footer__copyright-credits>Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/ rel="nofollow noopener" target=_blank>Hugo</a> and <a href=https://github.com/vimux/binario rel="nofollow noopener" target=_blank>Binario</a> theme.</span></div></footer></body></html>
