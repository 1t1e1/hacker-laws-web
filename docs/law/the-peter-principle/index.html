Peter</em></p></blockquote><p>A management concept developed by Laurence J. Peter, the Peter Principle observes that people who are good at their jobs are promoted, until they reach a level where they are no longer successful (their &ldquo;level of incompetence&rdquo;. At this point, as they are more senior, they are less likely to be removed from the organisation (unless they perform spectacularly badly) and will continue to reside in a role which they have few intrinsic skills at, as their original skills which made them successful are not necessarily the skills required for their new jobs.</p><p>This is of particular interest to engineers - who initial start out in deeply technical roles, but often have a career path which leads to <em>managing</em> other engineers - which requires a fundamentally different skills-set.</p><p>See Also:</p><ul><li><a href=https://1t1e1.github.io/hacker-laws-web/law/the-dilbert-principle/>The Dilbert Principle</a></li><li><a href=https://1t1e1.github.io/hacker-laws-web/law/putts-law/>Putt&rsquo;s Law</a></li></ul></div></article></div></main></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__copyright>Â© 2020 My Hugo Site. <span class=footer__copyright-credits>Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/ rel="nofollow noopener" target=_blank>Hugo</a> and <a href=https://github.com/vimux/binario rel="nofollow noopener" target=_blank>Binario</a> theme.</span></div></footer></body></html>
