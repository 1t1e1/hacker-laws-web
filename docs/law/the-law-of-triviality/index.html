It can be difficult to give valuable input on discussions about very large, complex topics without a high degree of subject matter expertise or preparation. However, people want to be seen to be contributing valuable input. Hence a tendency to focus too much time on small details, which can be reasoned about easily, but are not necessarily of particular importance.</p><p>The fictional example above led to the usage of the term &lsquo;Bike Shedding&rsquo; as an expression for wasting time on trivial details. An alternative term is &lsquo;Yak Shaving&rsquo;.</p></div></article></div></main></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__copyright>Â© 2020 My Hugo Site. <span class=footer__copyright-credits>Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/ rel="nofollow noopener" target=_blank>Hugo</a> and <a href=https://github.com/vimux/binario rel="nofollow noopener" target=_blank>Binario</a> theme.</span></div></footer></body></html>
