This law suggests that groups will give far more time and attention to trivial or cosmetic issues rather than serious and substantial ones.
The common fictional example used is that of a committee approving plans for nuclear power plant, who spend the majority of their time discussing the structure of the bike shed, rather than the far more important design for the power plant itself.</div></article></div><div class="card card--2col"><article class="post card__box block"><h1 class="post__title title-excerpt"><a class=post__title-link href=/hacker-laws-web/law/the-liskov-substitution-principle/>The Liskov Substitution Principle</a></h1><div class=post__content>The Liskov Substitution Principle on Wikipedia
It should be possible to replace a type with a subtype, without breaking the system.
The third of the &lsquo;SOLID&rsquo; principles. This principle states that if a component relies on a type, then it should be able to use subtypes of that type, without the system failing or having to know the details of what that subtype is.
As an example, imagine we have a method which reads an XML document from a structure which represents a file.</div></article></div><div class="card card--2col"><article class="post card__box block"><h1 class="post__title title-excerpt"><a class=post__title-link href=/hacker-laws-web/law/the-openclosed-principle/>The Open/Closed Principle</a></h1><div class=post__content>The Open/Closed Principle on Wikipedia
Entities should be open for extension and closed for modification.
The second of the &lsquo;SOLID&rsquo; principles. This principle states that entities (which could be classes, modules, functions and so on) should be able to have their behaviour extended, but that their existing behaviour should not be able to be modified.
As a hypothetical example, imagine a module which is able to turn a Markdown document into HTML.</div></article></div><div class="card card--2col"><article class="post card__box block"><h1 class="post__title title-excerpt"><a class=post__title-link href=/hacker-laws-web/law/the-pareto-principle-the-8020-rule/>The Pareto Principle (The 80/20 Rule)</a></h1><div class=post__content>The Pareto Principle on Wikipedia
Most things in life are not distributed evenly.
The Pareto Principle suggests that in some cases, the majority of results come from a minority of inputs:
80% of a certain piece of software can be written in 20% of the total allocated time (conversely, the hardest 20% of the code takes 80% of the time) 20% of the effort produces 80% of the result 20% of the work creates 80% of the revenue 20% of the bugs cause 80% of the crashes 20% of the features cause 80% of the usage In the 1940s American-Romanian engineer Dr.</div></article></div><div class="card card--2col"><article class="post card__box block"><h1 class="post__title title-excerpt"><a class=post__title-link href=/hacker-laws-web/law/the-peter-principle/>The Peter Principle</a></h1><div class=post__content>The Peter Principle on Wikipedia
People in a hierarchy tend to rise to their &ldquo;level of incompetence&rdquo;.
Laurence J. Peter
A management concept developed by Laurence J. Peter, the Peter Principle observes that people who are good at their jobs are promoted, until they reach a level where they are no longer successful (their &ldquo;level of incompetence&rdquo;. At this point, as they are more senior, they are less likely to be removed from the organisation (unless they perform spectacularly badly) and will continue to reside in a role which they have few intrinsic skills at, as their original skills which made them successful are not necessarily the skills required for their new jobs.</div></article></div><div class="card card--2col"><article class="post card__box block"><h1 class="post__title title-excerpt"><a class=post__title-link href=/hacker-laws-web/law/the-robustness-principle-postels-law/>The Robustness Principle (Postel's Law)</a></h1><div class=post__content>The Robustness Principle on Wikipedia
Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others.
Often applied in server application development, this principle states that what you send to others should be as minimal and conformant as possible, but you should be aim to allow non-conformant input if it can be processed.
The goal of this principle is to build systems which are robust, as they can handle poorly formed input if the intent can still be understood.</div></article></div><div class="card card--2col"><article class="post card__box block"><h1 class="post__title title-excerpt"><a class=post__title-link href=/hacker-laws-web/law/the-single-responsibility-principle/>The Single Responsibility Principle</a></h1><div class=post__content>The Single Responsibility Principle on Wikipedia
Every module or class should have a single responsibility only.
The first of the &lsquo;SOLID&rsquo; principles. This principle suggests that modules or classes should do one thing and one thing only. In more practical terms, this means that a single, small change to a feature of a program should require a change in one component only. For example, changing how a password is validated for complexity should require a change in only one part of the program.</div></article></div><div class="card card--2col"><article class="post card__box block"><h1 class="post__title title-excerpt"><a class=post__title-link href=/hacker-laws-web/law/the-spotify-model/>The Spotify Model</a></h1><div class=post__content>The Spotify Model on Spotify Labs
The Spotify Model is an approach to team and organisation structure which has been popularised by &lsquo;Spotify&rsquo;. In this model, teams are organised around features, rather than technologies.
The Spotify Model also popularises the concepts of Tribes, Guilds, Chapters, which are other components of their organisation structure.</div></article></div><div class="card card--2col"><article class="post card__box block"><h1 class="post__title title-excerpt"><a class=post__title-link href=/hacker-laws-web/law/the-unix-philosophy/>The Unix Philosophy</a></h1><div class=post__content>The Unix Philosophy on Wikipedia
The Unix Philosophy is that software components should be small, and focused on doing one specific thing well. This can make it easier to build systems by composing together small, simple, well-defined units, rather than using large, complex, multi-purpose programs.
Modern practices like &lsquo;Microservice Architecture&rsquo; can be thought of as an application of this law, where services are small, focused and do one specific thing, allowing complex behaviour to be composed of simple building blocks.</div></article></div><div class="card card--2col"><article class="post card__box block"><h1 class="post__title title-excerpt"><a class=post__title-link href=/hacker-laws-web/law/wadlers-law/>Wadler's Law</a></h1><div class=post__content>Wadler&rsquo;s Law on wiki.haskell.org
In any language design, the total time spent discussing a feature in this list is proportional to two raised to the power of its position.
Semantics Syntax Lexical syntax Lexical syntax of comments (In short, for every hour spent on semantics, 8 hours will be spent on the syntax of comments).
Similar to The Law of Triviality, Wadler&rsquo;s Law states what when designing a language, the amount of time spent on language structures is disproportionately high in comparison to the importance of those features.</div></article></div></div></main><div class="pagination block"><a class="pagination__item pagination__item--desktop" href=/hacker-laws-web/law/>1</a>
