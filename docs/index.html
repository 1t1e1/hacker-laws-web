Amdahl&rsquo;s Law is a formula which shows the potential speedup of a computational task which can be achieved by increasing the resources of a system. Normally used in parallel computing, it can predict the actual benefit of increasing the number of processors, which is limited by the parallelisability of the program.
Best illustrated with an example. If a program is made up of two parts, part A, which must be executed by a single processor, and part B, which can be parallelised, then we see that adding multiple processors to the system executing the program can only have a limited benefit.</div></article></div><div class="card card--2col"><article class="post card__box block"><h1 class="post__title title-excerpt"><a class=post__title-link href=/hacker-laws-web/law/brooks-law/>Brooks' Law</a></h1><div class=post__content>Brooks&rsquo; Law on Wikipedia
Adding human resources to a late software development project makes it later.
This law suggests that in many cases, attempting to accelerate the delivery of a project which is already late, by adding more people, will make the delivery even later. Brooks is clear that this is an over-simplification, however, the general reasoning is that given the ramp up time of new resources and the communication overheads, in the immediate short-term velocity decreases.</div></article></div><div class="card card--2col"><article class="post card__box block"><h1 class="post__title title-excerpt"><a class=post__title-link href=/hacker-laws-web/law/conways-law/>Conway's Law</a></h1><div class=post__content>Conway&rsquo;s Law on Wikipedia
This law suggests that the technical boundaries of a system will reflect the structure of the organisation. It is commonly referred to when looking at organisation improvements, Conway&rsquo;s Law suggests that if an organisation is structured into many small, disconnected units, the software it produces will be. If an organisation is built more around &lsquo;verticals&rsquo; which are orientated around features or services, the software systems will also reflect this.</div></article></div><div class="card card--2col"><article class="post card__box block"><h1 class="post__title title-excerpt"><a class=post__title-link href=/hacker-laws-web/law/cunninghams-law/>Cunningham's Law</a></h1><div class=post__content>Cunningham&rsquo;s Law on Wikipedia
The best way to get the right answer on the Internet is not to ask a question, it&rsquo;s to post the wrong answer.
According to Steven McGeady, Ward Cunningham advised him in the early 1980s: &ldquo;The best way to get the right answer on the Internet is not to ask a question, it&rsquo;s to post the wrong answer.&rdquo; McGeady dubbed this Cunningham&rsquo;s law, though Cunningham denies ownership calling it a &ldquo;misquote.</div></article></div><div class="card card--2col"><article class="post card__box block"><h1 class="post__title title-excerpt"><a class=post__title-link href=/hacker-laws-web/law/dunbars-number/>Dunbar's Number</a></h1><div class=post__content>Dunbar&rsquo;s Number on Wikipedia
&ldquo;Dunbar&rsquo;s number is a suggested cognitive limit to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social relationships— relationships in which an individual knows who each person is and how each person relates to every other person.&rdquo; There is some disagreement to the exact number. &ldquo;&mldr; [Dunbar] proposed that humans can comfortably maintain only 150 stable relationships.&rdquo; He put the number into a more social context, &ldquo;the number of people you would not feel embarrassed about joining uninvited for a drink if you happened to bump into them in a bar.</div></article></div><div class="card card--2col"><article class="post card__box block"><h1 class="post__title title-excerpt"><a class=post__title-link href=/hacker-laws-web/law/galls-law/>Gall's Law</a></h1><div class=post__content>Gall&rsquo;s Law on Wikipedia
A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system.
(John Gall)
Gall&rsquo;s Law implies that attempts to design highly complex systems are likely to fail. Highly complex systems are rarely built in one go, but evolve instead from more simple systems.</div></article></div><div class="card card--2col"><article class="post card__box block"><h1 class="post__title title-excerpt"><a class=post__title-link href=/hacker-laws-web/law/goodharts-law/>Goodhart's Law</a></h1><div class=post__content>The Goodhart&rsquo;s Law on Wikipedia
Any observed statistical regularity will tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it for control purposes.
Charles Goodhart

When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.
Marilyn Strathern
The law states that the measure-driven optimizations could lead to devaluation of the measurement outcome itself. Overly selective set of measures (KPIs) blindly applied to a process results in distorted effect.</div></article></div><div class="card card--2col"><article class="post card__box block"><h1 class="post__title title-excerpt"><a class=post__title-link href=/hacker-laws-web/law/hanlons-razor/>Hanlon's Razor</a></h1><div class=post__content>Hanlon&rsquo;s Razor on Wikipedia
Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.
Robert J. Hanlon
This principle suggests that actions resulting in a negative outcome were not a result of ill will. Instead the negative outcome is more likely attributed to those actions and/or the impact being not fully understood.</div></article></div><div class="card card--2col"><article class="post card__box block"><h1 class="post__title title-excerpt"><a class=post__title-link href=/hacker-laws-web/law/hofstadters-law/>Hofstadter's Law</a></h1><div class=post__content>Hofstadter&rsquo;s Law on Wikipedia
It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter&rsquo;s Law.
(Douglas Hofstadter)
You might hear this law referred to when looking at estimates for how long something will take. It seems a truism in software development that we tend to not be very good at accurately estimating how long something will take to deliver.
This is from the book &lsquo;Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid'.</div></article></div><div class="card card--2col"><article class="post card__box block"><h1 class="post__title title-excerpt"><a class=post__title-link href=/hacker-laws-web/law/hutbers-law/>Hutber's Law</a></h1><div class=post__content>Hutber&rsquo;s Law on Wikipedia
Improvement means deterioration.
(Patrick Hutber)
This law suggests that improvements to a system will lead to deterioration in other parts, or it will hide other deterioration, leading overall to a degradation from the current state of the system.
For example, a decrease in response latency for a particular end-point could cause increased throughput and capacity issues further along in a request flow, affecting an entirely different sub-system.</div></article></div></div></main><div class="pagination block"><span class="pagination__item pagination__item--active" data-total=5>1</span>
